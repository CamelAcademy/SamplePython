Use a standard installation of Python 2.7.
Python script summarize-enron.py can be run from the 
[Unix] command line in the format:

```
> python summarize-enron.py enron-event-history-all.csv
```
The Enron event history (.csv, adapted from the widely-used publicly available
data set) is included. The columns contain:

* **time** - time is Unix time (in milliseconds)
* **message identifier**
* **sender**
* **recipients** - pipe-separated list of email recipients
* **topic** - always empty
* **mode** - always "email"

Requirements:

1. A .csv file with three columns---"person", "sent", "received"---where the
   final two columns contain the number of emails that person sent or received
   in the data set. This file should be sorted by the number of emails sent.

2. A PNG image visualizing the number of emails sent over time by some of the
   most prolific senders in (1). There are no specific guidelines regarding the
   format and specific content of the visualization---you can choose which and
   how many senders to include, and the type of plot---but you should strive to
   make it as clear and informative as possible, making sure to represent time
   in some meaningful way.

3. A visualization that shows, for the same people, the number of unique
   people/email addresses who contacted them over the same time period. The raw
   number of unique incoming contacts is not quite as important as the relative
   numbers (compared across the individuals from (2) ) and how they change over
   time.
